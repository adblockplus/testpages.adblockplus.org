This page tests if a custom hiding filter (##.abp-test-hiding-filter) and exception filter (testpages.adblockplus.org#@#.abp-test-hiding-filter) is working.

<h3>Instructions</h3>

If the custom hiding filter and the exception is installed and enabled, you should see "Exception filter was applied" below.

If the custom hiding filter is installed and enabled but the exception filter is NOT, you should see "First hiding filter was applied" or "2nd/3rd hiding filter was applied" below.

If the custom hiding filter and the exception is not installed or is disabled, you should see "NO hiding filters or exception filters are applied" below.
